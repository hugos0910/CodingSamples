# CodingSamples
These are some of my coding samples from engineering courses I have taken.  I have attached assignments from two different courses, Advanced Gas Dynamics (AE510) and Viscous Flow (TAM532).  I have also attached an assignment from the current Coursera machine learning course I am enrolled in.
## AE510
The goal of this assignment was to solved the steady-state flowfield of a converging-diverging nozzle using MacCormack's method.  MacCormack's method involves using a "predictor" step and a "corrector" step, which are programmed into two separate functions.
## TAM532
The goal of this assignment was to calculate the development of a laminar shear layer for fluids with different properties.  BlasiusFunc is fed into the MATLAB ode45 integrator for integration.
