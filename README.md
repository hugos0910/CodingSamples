# CodingSamples
These are some of my coding samples from engineering courses I have taken.  I have attached assignments from two different courses, Advanced Gas Dynamics (AE510) and Viscous Flow (TAM532). I have also attached an assignment I designed with other teaching assistants for an introductory programming class for college freshmen (CS105).
## AE510
The goal of this assignment was to solved the steady-state flowfield of a converging-diverging nozzle using MacCormack's method.  MacCormack's method involves using a "predictor" step and a "corrector" step, which are programmed into two separate functions.  The main file is named AE510_MaCormack.m.
## TAM532
The goal of this assignment was to calculate the development of a laminar shear layer for fluids with different properties.  BlasiusFunc is fed into the MATLAB ode45 integrator for integration.  The main file is name TAM532_ShearLayer.m.
## CS105
The index.html file prompts the user to enter a 9-letter word in random order, and it will sort through the words provided by the word bank in words.js to find a match.
