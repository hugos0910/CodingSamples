# CodingSamples
These are some of my coding samples from engineering courses I have taken.  I have attached assignments from three different courses, Advanced Gas Dynamics (AE510), Viscous Flow (TAM532), and Orbital Mechanics (AE402).
## AE510
The goal of this assignment was to solved the steady-state flowfield of a converging-diverging nozzle using MacCormack's method.  MacCormack's method involves using a "predictor" step and a "corrector" step, which are programmed into two separate functions.
